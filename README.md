# ðŸŒŸ Pattern Printer in C++

A fun, menu-driven C++ console app that prints classic and advanced star & number patterns â€” **now in color!**  
Perfect for beginners to learn loops, conditions, modular code *and* adding a polished console look.

---

## ðŸŽ¨ New: Colored patterns!
Each pattern is printed in its own color (green, blue, cyan, magenta, etc.)  
This makes the output more fun, readable, and impressive â€” especially when sharing or demoing.

*(Uses ANSI escape codes, supported by most modern terminals like Linux/macOS and Windows 10+)*


## **All pattern outputs**

Below are examples of all 7 patterns printed by this program, each in its own color.
